Server Start Location
--------------

This simple mod adds a start position that all new players start at 
automatically, and players warp to on death.

Use
---

It adds a new privilege, startlocation. With this privilege, you have access 
to the following new commands:

/setstart - sets the start location to wherever the invoking user is standing.

/gotostart - teleport to the start location

/allongotostart - teleport all players online to the start location.

In addition, if there is a valid start location then all NEW players will 
begin life at the start location.
Also, players will begin at the start location upon respawning.
